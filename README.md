# AI Coding Assistant for WASP-lang, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS

## Overview

This project implements an advanced AI coding assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude model. The assistant specializes in WASP-lang, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, providing step-by-step guidance and generating code that meets specific user requirements.

## Key Features

- Expertise in WASP-lang, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Step-by-step problem-solving approach with detailed pseudocode planning
- Generation of complete, functional code blocks
- Focus on component reusability, state management, and best practices
- Optimized caching strategy for reduced token usage and costs

## Technical Capabilities

- WASP-lang integration with TypeScript and React
- Type-safe, clean, and maintainable TypeScript code
- Responsive and dynamic React user interfaces
- Modern and responsive designs using Tailwind CSS
- Backend integration considerations (REST APIs or GraphQL)
- Deployment guidance for platforms like Vercel and Netlify

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-coding-assistant.git
   cd ai-coding-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.server` file in the root directory and add your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the AI coding assistant, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory:
   ```
   cd ai-coding-assistant
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   wasp start
   ```

3. Once the server is running, you can interact with the AI coding assistant through the provided user interface or API endpoints.

4. To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it's running.

## Usage Guidelines

When interacting with the AI coding assistant:

1. Provide clear, specific instructions for your coding tasks.
2. For complex projects, break down your requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.
3. Specify if you need explanations or just the code output.
4. Review the generated code and pseudocode plans carefully.
5. Feel free to ask for modifications or optimizations of the generated code.

## Monitoring and Optimization

The AI coding assistant uses an optimized caching strategy to reduce token usage and costs. To monitor its effectiveness, check the server logs for the following metrics:

- Input Tokens
- Output Tokens
- Cache Creation Input Tokens
- Cache Read Input Tokens

These metrics will help you understand the token usage and potential cost savings.
